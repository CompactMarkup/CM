# Compact Markup (CM)

This is an implementation of Compact Markup (CM) - a lightweight, simple and unambiguous, configurable and extensible document markup language.

The intended use of Compact Markup is to create book-like web sites â€• so-called CM-Books.

CM documentation is itself a CM-Book and serves also as a canonical CM-Book template.
